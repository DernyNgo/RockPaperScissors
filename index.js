// begin with a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'
// Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors.
// The function should take two parameters: playerSelection and computerSelection
// Return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
// Make the function's playerSelection parameter case-insensitive so users can input Rock, ROCK, RoCK, etc...
// you want to return, not log the results of the function call
// Write a NEW function called game(). Call the playRound function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end
// ^ Use a loop 
// Use console log to display the results of each round and the winner at the end
// Use prompt() to get input from the user
